# Ai_3d_pygame
Alright — I checked out the GitHub repository at **codewith-ram/Ai\_3d\_pygame** and confirmed it exists, although the contents couldn’t fully load in the preview.([GitHub][1])

I’ve updated the README you shared earlier to better match your GitHub structure. Here’s a revamped version, now personalized for your **codewith-ram/Ai\_3d\_pygame** repository:

# AI-Powered 3D PyGame Visualizer (DeepSeek R1)

A Streamlit-based project showcasing **R1's** abilities to generate and visualize PyGame code from natural language prompts. Powered by **DeepSeek** for reasoning, **OpenAI GPT-4o** for code extraction, and automated browser agents for execution and visualization via **Trinket.io**.

---

## Features

* **Natural-language to PyGame code**: Describe what you want, and the system generates it.
* **DeepSeek Reasoning**: Processes the prompt to produce logic and a code foundation.
* **OpenAI Extraction**: Refines and cleans the code into executable form.
* **Trinket.io Automation**: Browser agents navigate, input code, run it, and display visuals.
* **Streamlit Frontend**: A sleek, interactive UI to streamline the experience.
* **Modular Agents**: Separate agents handle:

  * Navigation to Trinket.io
  * Code input
  * Execution
  * Visualization rendering

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codewith-ram/Ai_3d_pygame.git
   cd Ai_3d_pygame
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Secure your API keys:

   * **DeepSeek**: register and get your API key from their platform.
   * **OpenAI**: sign up and obtain your API key on OpenAI.

4. Launch the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run ai_3dpygame_r1.py
   ```

5. Interact: A browser window will open. Follow the provided URL to enter descriptions and generate 3D PyGame visualizations!

---

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter a natural language description of your desired PyGame scene.
2. **DeepSeek Reasoning**: Generates structured logic and initial code based on your input.
3. **Code Refinement**: OpenAI GPT-4o cleans and formats the logic into runnable Python code.
4. **Visualization Pipeline**:

   * **Agent A**: Opens Trinket.io in a browser.
   * **Agent B**: Inserts the cleaned code.
   * **Agent C**: Runs the code.
   * **Agent D**: Captures and displays the visual output.
5. **UI Layer**: Streamlit ties everything together—input, backend processing, and output display in one interface.

Let me know if you’d like tweaks—maybe adjust the filename (e.g. if it’s named differently than `ai_3dpygame_r1.py`), or specify more advanced features or future directions such as multi-object scripting, physics integrations, or saving visual outputs!
